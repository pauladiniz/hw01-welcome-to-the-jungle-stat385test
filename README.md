# hw01: Welcome to Jungle

The objective behind this homework assignment is to give graded practice with
writing using the literate programming techniques discussed in class. In
addition, students will be asked to read in and summarize data found in an 
_R_ package and online.

## Overview

Please use the `hw01-assign.Rmd` document as a template for your assignment.
**Note:** You must _rename_ `hw01-assign.Rmd` to `hw01-netid.Rmd`, where `NetID`
is your `NetID` infront of `NetID@illinois.edu`. 

Make sure to commit your _rendered_ files (e.g. `hw01-netid.html` or `hw01-netid.pdf`) 
into this directory as well. 

## Files Included

### Common files

- `README.md`: a file that provides guidance as to what the assignment is and 
  what is contained inside the repository. 
    - You are reading this file right now!
- `hw01-assign.Rmd`: the RMarkdown file containing the homework assignment.
- `.gitignore`: an optional file that _RStudio_ may generate, which prevents 
  certain files from being **committed** into the repository as they have no value.
- `<REPO-NAME>.Rproj`: an optional file that is generated when an _RStudio_ 
  project is created. As we are using RStudio Cloud, this file will likely be
  generated on import. 

### Infrastructure for Testing

- `.travis.yml`: provides a foundation for performing 
   [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.com) checks, or verify that we
   can render/create output from your RMarkdown file. If your RMarkdown file 
   is correct, then "Build Status" badge that should be inserted inside this
   `README` will be green and show say "build success." Otherwise, the badge 
   will be red to indicate that a "build failure" occurred. Build failures 
   occur if: 
    - Image files have not been committed or the path to the image file is
      inappropriate. _Hint:_ Use relative paths!
    - You added an additional package that was not listed in the `DESCRIPTION` 
      file and, thus, is not available when travis tries to build the `.Rmd` file.
- `DESCRIPTION`: a file associated with _R Packages_ that indicates 
   to **Travis** what dependencies must be installed in order to build the `.Rmd` files.
- `test/render_rmds.R`: a short _R_ script that finds all instances of
   the `.Rmd` files and attempts to build them! 

# Acknowledgement

The testing apparatus (e.g. `/test`) and portions of the README were based off
of an example done by [Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info).
