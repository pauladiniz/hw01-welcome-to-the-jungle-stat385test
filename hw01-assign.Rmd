## Note on Markdown

If you need help with markdown syntax, please go to the "Help" menu and select the 
_Markdown Quick Reference_ guide. This will open in the **Help** tab on
the _lower-right_ corner of _RStudio_. For more examples, please see 
[the literate programming slides](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/lectures/02-literate-programming/02-literate-programming.pdf#page=26) and the  [in class examples of writing in _RMarkdown_](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/djhtvrr2f07uyzi/01-22-2018-rmarkdown-sample.Rmd?dl=0).


# Assignment

## (2 points) Exercise 0: Get aboard the GitHub Bus!

Place a link to your `hw01` GitHub repository here.

<https://github.com/stat385-sp2018/hw01-welcome-to-the-jungle-stat385test.git>

## (2 points) Exercise 1: Homework Policy

Please uncomment the following statement when you have read and agreed
to the [homework policy](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/homework-policy/).
To _uncomment_ a statement in _RMarkdown_ delete the `<!-- -->` surrounding
the content.

<!-- I have read and agree to abide by the policies and procedures laid 
out by the [homework policy](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com/homework-policy/).
I understand that:

- I must independently write up solutions to homework problems.
    - Failure to do so will result in an academic integrity violation due to plagarism and more severe penalties.
- I must list the names of all collaborators that I work with at the top of
  my homework assignment.
- I understand that I can work with **at most** three other students in class. 
- I will turn in my homework by committing to the GitHub repository that was
  setup for me via GitHub classrooms.
    - There is no paper or e-mail turn-in available. 
- I must make all commits using `git` and _not_ the GitHub web interface.
    - If I do, I will lose all the points associated with the `git` commits.
- I will be able to drop one homework assignment over the course of the 
  semester.

## (10 Points) Exercise 5: Got baby?

**[2 Points] (a)** Install and load the `babynames` package. 
**Comment** out the installation command in your `.Rmd` file. 
(If you do not comment installation commands out, then they will be run
every time you knit your `.Rmd` file.) 



**[2 Points] (b)** Open up the help documentation for `babynames` (the data set),
find where the variables for the data set are listed and write in your
_RMarkdown_ document _how_ the `prop`  variable was created.


**[6 Points] (c)** Provide summary information on the `babynames` by:

- writing a sentence that _dynamically_ describes the dimensions of the data;
- showing the last six observations in the data set; and,
- providing a summary overview of the data to understand its contents.





##  (12 Points) Exercise 6: Excellency at UIUC

Under this exercise, we will explore the "Teachers Ranked As Excellent" data
at UIUC from Fall 1993 to Present as compiled by [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider
](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/). Please download the data from:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wadefagen/Teachers-Ranked-As-Excellent-UIUC/master/TRE-UIUC-AllYears.csv> 

This data has a file extension of **CSV** form. Contained in the data are the
following variables:

- `term`: Two letter semester code (`sp`, `su`, `fa`, or `wi`) followed by a four digit year.
    - Examples: `sp2017`, `fa2013`, `su2012`.
- `unit`: The CITL-supplied headers for the unit teaching the course.
    - Examples: `ACCOUNTANCY`, `SOCIAL WORK`, `LINGUISTICS`, `NUCLEAR, PLASMA & RAD. ENGR.`
- `lname`: The last name of the teacher.
    - Examples: `FAGEN-ULMSCHNEIDER`, `FLANAGAN`, `FLECK`
- `fname`: The first letter of the first name of the teacher.
    - Examples: `W`, `K`, `M`
- `role`: `Instructor` or `TA`
- `ranking`: `Excellent` or `Outstanding`
- `course`: The course the teacher was ranked as excellent.  If no course is given, the `course` field is set to `?` (this includes cases when the raw data lists the course as `0`, `000`, or `999`).
    - Examples: `199`, `225`, `560`, `?`

**[2 points] (a)** Import into _R_ the data in `TRE-UIUC-AllYears.csv` with the 
variable name `tre_data`. As `course` contains a value that is _not_ `NA`, which
is how _R_ represents missing values, you must use the parameter 
`na.strings = c("?", "NA")` in the appropriate `read.*()` function. 
If you need help, please see the appropriate help documentation via `?`.

**NB** The `*` in the `read.*()` statement is a placeholder for the type of file
you want to read in. 


**[2 points] (b)**  Retrieve the dimensional information for this data using
only one function.



**[4 points] (c)** Perform a summary of the `tre_data`. Are there any summaries
that are surprising? What might have caused this? 

_Hint_ Consider looking at the structure of `tre_data`. 





**[4 points] (d)** Fix the following code so that it:

1. doesn't error;
1. produces a graph; and 
1. hides the code.

_Hint_ for the last exercise look at different code chunk options.

```{r ggplot2-code, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(tre_data, aes(ranking)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap( ~role) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(y = "Frequency",
       x = "Excellency Rating")
```
